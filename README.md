QTXbee
======

A QT 5.1 API Library for use with XBee DigiMesh modems 

The code has been tested against XBEE PRO 900HP modems running Version 8067.

All the basic send and receive features of the api have been tested to some degree.  The rest should work as it's replicating the same framework.

I've used slots and signals to handle the callbacks, so the code should be fairly efficient.

Feel free to drop me an email - ajpocock@gmail.com - if you find anything that doesn't look right.  I'm also happy to have people contribute to the code and patch or expand it.

Enjoy!

Anthony
